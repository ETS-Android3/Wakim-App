We are tasked to develop a project where they will apply not only the basics of Java programming, but also Java design patterns, and best practices in Java.
Preferably a project that is related to our hobbies or interests yet I decided to develop a project that could personally benefit me.

Overview:
* Native android Application featuring an alarm system that would force me to wake up by scanning a specific QR Code.
* CRUD application with Room Database
* Uses Java design patterns and best practices
